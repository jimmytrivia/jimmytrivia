# Jimmy John's Menu Trivia 

This is a test for Jimmy John’s Team Members to help master the menu.

There are 15 questions generated about the menu that you have 15 seconds to answer.

I used JavaScript and jQuery to keep the game moving. 

The trivia is responsive and works well on phones.

To test your knowledge and become a Menu Master go to JimmyTrivia.github.io
